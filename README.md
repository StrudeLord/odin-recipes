Current project is about recalling information I have learned from the Odin Project.

Task is to make an web page called Recipes.
Page will have a few sub-pages for individual recipes.

In the process I will remember the following:

1. How to navigate shell.
2. How to create an organized web directory.
3. How to create an html file with meaningful content.
4. How to utilize git commit function.
5. How to write appropriate commit comments.
